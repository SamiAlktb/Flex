A project to host many operating systems in one place, from ready-to-install operating systems that include all versions of the Windows operating system.

All of this can be protected with end-to-end encryption, with a password that can be customized to get started.

In addition to all distributions of the Linux operating system, as well as auxiliary operating systems that work to solve hardware problems and even check them to find the problem if you do not know it, Linux distributions for ethical hacking and knowing if the device is vulnerable to hacking or not.

And other Linux distributions for browsing safely on the Internet, in addition to independent operating systems dedicated to protection, checking devices and solving problems.

There is also a special section within the project contains many files, documents, and customizations away from the operating systems, including basic service applications, and also applications for testing and protection.

All in one place for ease of use and dispensing with carrying many disks and replacing them with only one disk.

So using this open source system, you can:

- Install Windows versions (from Windows 7 to Windows 11)
- Install all Linux distributions
- Checking devices & finding technical problems using specialized operating systems for testing
- Check if the device has been hacked
- Browse any content on the Internet securely and anonymously 100%
- Extract all kinds of important files from storage drives that suffer from operating system problems
- Run multiple operating systems in a stable and secure manner in one device
- Find all applications and services to install them on all operating systems safely and legally
- Take a separate backup of all operating systems and even mobile devices
